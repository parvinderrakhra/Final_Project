## Game Outline

BTS is a AAA-class First-person Shooter (FPS) video game in the metaverse, where gamers fight against the environment (P2E), and each other (PvP) to complete different challenges/missions, to unlock teleportation and time travel in the metaverse. The game is a battle between 4 factions, with each gamer contributing to gather rare NFTs across different missions, levels, and PvP.  BTS can be played both in First Person Shooter (FPS) and Third Person Shooter (TPS) mode. 
The goal of the game is to unlock time travel for their faction. The faction that unlocks time travel gets to progress to the next season, with their Heroes, Weapons, Levels, and NFTs, and they get certain advantages as the game progresses.
