## Why Blockchain Game?
Gaming Industry is one of the largest entertainment industries in the world, which generate more revenue than the global movie and North American sports industries combined.

The gaming industry is always hungry, and with blockchain by its side, we can only see the disruption. From ownership to royalties, from finding rare items to acquiring trinkets, the 3 billion gamers worldwide are all set to get more from this technology that is capable of addressing many pain points.

 Blockchain gaming uses the same technology as cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, to create true item ownership. It is seen as a boon by gamers who often get stuck with in-game entities. 

Blockchain gaming technology allows gamers to customize their gaming items, develop their characters, and make them unique. They can also transfer them to other users and trade them on the platform. As a result of this unique feature, users tend to gravitate towards blockchain gaming as they can own the game assets while playing independently. 

 Many rare and valuable NFTs are traded within gaming industries, exemplifying this trend. 


## Game Set-up
Earth is going through multiple challenges, scarcity of food, famine, and a pandemic which wiped out half the earth’s population and is being continuously raided by aliens and extra-terrestrial life.  In order to survive they would have fight to survive and keep growing
BornToSurvive is not only a game but a metaverse. The actions here mimick the actions in the real world, or, inspired by real-world actions. 
The MetaVerse would have:
* Gym and Training Ground - to train and improve their skills, strength, power
* Rest and Restaurant – to rest, eat and stay healthy.
* Vehicle Garage and more TBD


## Game Outline

BTS is a AAA-class First-person Shooter (FPS) video game in the metaverse, where gamers fight against the environment (P2E), and each other (PvP) to complete different challenges/missions, to unlock teleportation and time travel in the metaverse. The game is a battle between 4 factions, with each gamer contributing to gather rare NFTs across different missions, levels, and PvP.  BTS can be played both in First Person Shooter (FPS) and Third Person Shooter (TPS) mode. 
The goal of the game is to unlock time travel for their faction. The faction that unlocks time travel gets to progress to the next season, with their Heroes, Weapons, Levels, and NFTs, and they get certain advantages as the game progresses.
 4 Fractions are as follow - more details to follow soon.

In BTS – the players can play the game to earn rewards.  The game play will unlock different rare NFTs, opportunities to upgrade NFTs, weapons, Armours, Avatar and more.  Some gamers can dedicate themselves towards farming of weapons, avatars, armours, etc, while others towards progressing on the challenge and achieving goals. Additional rewards, NFTs, tokens are subject to the discretion of the BTS token holders.

Note: Once launched, BTS would be community driven.  Investors, developers, and gamers, with certain amount of BTS tokens, would be able to vote on various motions and proposals.

## Gameplay

There are 2 different types of mining/progress needed. These can be done by a single gamer/hero, or collaborate with other gamers to move forward in the mission. 
Heroes - As Heroes progress thru the armies, they need to keep upgrading themselves and level up. The alien army gets increasingly tougher and more difficult to kill and move thru. 
* There are 100+ base heroes, available in NFTs. Each Hero has different traits, e.g. Speed, Agility, Strength, Power, and Skills. Some might have some meta-skills which could be temporary and/or permanent. As they progress thru different levels, the Heroes level up using different NFTs.  
Note:  These NFTs can be traded, leased, and sold in NFT marketplace – (TBD)
NFTs - Increasingly, higher levels of weapons are needed as they progress thru the armies. The weapons can be upgraded by minting NFTs and upgrading their weapons in the forge. There are different forgeries, with different levels of weapons being made.
* Guns and Ammunition
* Armors and Protection
* Vehicles and Transport
* Resources, Elements, & Compounds – used to forge weapons, build schools/infrastructure and plant trees
* Gems and Rare Metals
* Skins, Suits

### Note:  
* a limit would be imposed on how much NFTs a single wallet/individual can collect.
* All these NFTs can be either bought or leased at market price using BTS token (some of these NFTs would be own by game – so as to provide service to gamers, even when no one else is)
* Some of these NFTs would be breedable, which could be used in-game to generate an offspring aka a new NFT (more details to come)


## Game Economy
BTS economy is designed to take into consideration different stakeholders and goes both deep and wide, connecting gamers, investors, and traders in every aspect of the gameplay. There are 3 segments of the economy: Execution, Development, and Ecosystem. 
Rewards from skilled gameplay (Execution) are the main source of input into the game economy. These rewards flow into the Development and the ecosystem creating a thriving economy. 
Components to build the in-game assets come from the development segment. Along with mining new Guns, Ammunitions, Vehicles, Armors, and more, NFTs for upgrades and elements to help upgrades are also mined. The number of NFTs available are either Minted with Proof of Play, or DAO governed ensuring transparency and fairness. 
It is not just a game, but a metaverse. The Ecosystem helps the game progress eg: Weapon Forgery, Gymnasium, etc playing the important role of enabling upgrades, thus advancing the gameplay. These places themselves also need to level up, to be able to serve a higher level of upgrades.  

### Earning
BTS tokens would be earned by players as a reward to every kill.  As the Hero kills the enemy, they get tokens in rewards on every kill. As the levels increase, the kill rewards increase as well. 
The kill reward is with in-game tokens. These tokens can be traded for goods/services in the marketplace or converted to other tokens in the exchange and withdraw funds.  And these tokens could also be used to improve the environment and infrastructure.
Simultaneously, earned tokens would be lost if hit by enemy.  Similarly, if periodic updates are not made in the game, eg: taking rest, training, and going to gym would also result in loosing tokens.


### Burning
Simultaneously, earned tokens would be lost if hit by an enemy.  Similarly, if periodic updates are not made in the game, eg: taking rest, training, and going to gym, it would result in losing tokens.
If the Hero dies, a percentage (20%) of the tokens, resources, and NFTs carried by them at that moment is lost.  There is a need to carry more tokens in the game to be able to mint Rare NFTs, and at the same time, there is this risk of losing 20% of the tokens if they get killed during the process.

### Tax
A tax of 10% on earned tokens & in-game assets and NFTs - 50% of which would go to R&D fund and 50% tokens would be burned

### BTS Tokens
A unique tokenomics to control inflation. Max supply of 100 million tokens. 

### Genesis NFT
All the Genesis NFTs are available for staking in the game. Different genesis NFTs have different staking multiples and different rewards defined as well. 

This NFT staking works:
* There is a start date for staking the NFTs. 
* There is a grace period to be able to withdraw staking. Once staked, the NFTs will not be open for trading till all the NFTs are staked and rewards distributed. (This is to prevent new investors from getting cheated by buying NFTs expecting rewards when they have already been claimed.)
* Some of the genesis NFTs can only be staked with a certain multiple. (details soon)

### Hero NFTs
Heroes form the core of every gameplay. That makes these NFTs one of the most sort after NFTs in the BTS metaverse.

### Hero NFT Derivatives
As the game gains popularity, rather than selling more Hero NFTs, we will be giving Hero NFT Derivatives, benefitting all investors.

### In-Game Assets NFTs
Every gun, jacket, night vision goggles, car, etc in the In-Game Asset list is an NFT, that can be traded, and used in the gameplay.
